# Blockchain Projects on Solana and EVM(Ethereum, Binance, Avalanche, Polygon, Aurora).

I have built several Solana and Ethereum-based NFT, DeFi, and P2E projects, including minting, staking, evolution/breeding features, raffle/auction houses, Launchpad, Marketplace, and Play-to-Earn (P2E) games. My repositories are private, and I am also working on AI-powered Agents and Trading Bots for Solana & Ethereum Networks.
